# There are two hxml files here, buildLib and buildLocal.

## buildLocal
is used when you clone the entire github repository and want to test in the HaxeAL source folder (hence, locally).

## buildLib 
is used if you downloaded HaxeAL-Soft via haxelib, in which case you just run said buildLib file and it should allow you to run the example.
